***How to determine exposure from LED panels Lux specifications, for photographers***

LED panels are getting cheaper and more readily available and photographers may consider using them as a substitute to strobes. Here I am talking about the small, battery powered panels normally used by videographers, not the big continuous lights used in photography studios or film sets. These panels are the size and weight of small strobe units and can be mounted on the camera hot shoe. In fact the form factor is quite convenient, being very similar to smarphones. And additionally, they work independently form the camer system, so, for instance, they can be used to vintage film cameras equipped with only a "cold shoe".

The downside of these units is that they are far less powerful than strobes of equivalent size. However, determining the light output generated by these lights in units of measure typically used in photography is not straightforward. Indeed, LED panes' specifications for what concearns light ouput are normally expressed in Lux (lx) measured at a certain distance from the source. When considering whether a specific LED panel would be of much use for a photographer, it would be useful to know the  Exposure Value (EV) that corresponds to the panel's' specification: what ISO, shutter speed and aperture values are needed to correctly expose an object illuminated by the panel from a given distance?

Luckily, we can convert between EV and lx. That is to say that it is possible to determine the photographic exposure necessary to photograph an object receiving a given amount of light expressed in lx. The conversio formula found on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value#EV_as_a_measure_of_luminance_and_illuminance) is simple:
$$lx=2.5 * 2^{EV_{100}}$$
Where $lx$ is illuminance in Lux, and $EV_{100}$ is the Exposure Value at iso 100 (this corresponds to the Light Value (LV)).

I was interested in the a very portable panel for use in macrophotography, as a fill light in portraits (quite rarely) or as a main light for a portrait-range, dark scene. An example of such tool is the [Lume Cube Light Go](https://lumecube.com/products/panel-go) which is rated at 1080 lx measured 0.5 metres away. I wanted to know if I could use such a light for the above scenes. To take the most demanding one (i.e. as main light), I would like to know if it can give me enough light to shoot hand-held when focussing at 1 m with ISO 400 film and a 50 mm f:2.8 lens. With my film SLR I can hand-hold sharp shots with a 50mm down to 1/60''. This means LV7 or EV9 at ISO 400.

To do so, I set up some R code with the conversion functions:


    # From Light Values to Lux
    lv2lux <- function(lv) (2^lv)*2.5  
    
    # From Lux to Light Values
    lux2lv <- function(lux) log(lux/2.5, 2)

And plotted the curve from LV5 to lv11, which represent dark settings in which flash would be useful. Since light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (inverse square law) if the distance doubles, the light intensity drops by two stops (25% of intensity at original distance). So, if the panel generates 1080 lx at 0.5 m, it would generate a fourth of that (270 lx) at 1 m. What is the corresponding LV of this? We can see from the curve (and from the code) it is a quarter of a stop less than LV7 (LV6.75).

This means that by keeping the panel on-camera, I could just barely expose for an object at 1 m away, 1.5 m if I had an f:2 lense, or if I could hand-hold 1/30'', and 2 m if I had an f:2 lense **and** I could hand-hold 1/30''.

    lv <- seq(5,11,.5)
    lux <- lv2lux(lv)
    plot(lv, lux, type = "l",
         xlab = "Light Values [LV]", ylab = "Lux [lx]",
         col = "red")
    points(lux2lv(1080/4), 1080/4, col = "blue")
    text(lux2lv(1080/4), 1080/4, col = "blue",
         labels = paste0("LV", round(lux2lv(1080/4), 2), ", ", 1080/4, " lx"),
         adj = c(1,-1))

To conclude, the [Lume Cube Light Go](https://lumecube.com/products/panel-go) may just be usefull in very limited circumstances, and not really be able to subtitue a strobe for most of the uses a strobe is normally used for...
